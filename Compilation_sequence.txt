COMPILER DOES NOT WATCH OVER THE SEQUENCE OF
DECLARATION OF FUNCTION BUT LINKER DOES .

1>Preprocessing
In this comments are trimmed and # act as it's
directive and preprocessing is done.
COMMAND: g++ -E file.cpp
file is saved with extesion (.i)

2>Compilation 
Translation to assembly code
COMMAND: g++ -S file.cpp 
and  file is saved as file.S

3>Assembler 
Translate assembly code to object code 
COMMAND : g++ -c file.cpp
nano file.o gives the encoded formatted object
code.
od -c file.o gives the object code in human readable
manner

4>Linking
object code now consist of machine instructions
,but some pieces are missing or in different
order ,these are linked using linker.
g++ file.cpp -o obj 
create obj.exe file
